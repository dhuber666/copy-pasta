# CopyPasta

A web application for copy and pasting text

**How to contribute?**

You can fork or clone the project.
Go into the project and write `yarn install` or `npm install`
You need to copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` and then fill out the required parameters. You can leave `EMAIL_SERVER` and `EMAIL_FROM` blank if you don't want to use email signin for now, since they require a smtp server.

After that just run `yarn dev`
